## Key Features
- The application implements a dynamic parallax effect in the PageView by using the `Transform.translate` method to create a smooth and engaging visual experience. 
- The effect is achieved by adjusting the offset of widgets based on the page offset and a Gaussian function, creating a sense of depth as the user scrolls through pages.
- Custom AppBar with Google Fonts.
- Dynamic PageView with a parallax effect.
- Custom widgets for additional functionalities.
- Responsive design using the flutter_screenutil package.
